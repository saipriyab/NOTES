Spring we are using as a replacement for EJB
Using spring can be deployed on local system with limited CPU withour using application server like JBOSS
Spring is open source framework
Spring Dependency injection gluee the clasess keeping them independent
Loosecoupled in spring is acheived by dependency injection
IOC gives the contrl of creating objects to the spring container
Loose coupling is used to glue the classes keeping them independent.

Spring provides five types of collections .They are:
---------------------------------------------------
1.Array
2.List
3.Set
4.Map
5.Props

Injecting null and empty value

<bean id="myBean" class="MyBean">
<property name="userName" vlaue=""/>
</bean>

<bean id="myBean" class="myBean">
<property name="userName"><null/></property>
</bean>

Spring namespace is used as an alertnative to property tag


Spring autowiring modes:
1.no
2.byName
3.byType
4.constructor

If we have both constructor and setter ,setter will ovverride the properties of constructor
